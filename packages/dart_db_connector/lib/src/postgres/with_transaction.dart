/// Convenience helpers that wrap [PostgresUnitOfWork] lifecycle in a
/// single call.
///
/// Usage (`binding` resolved internally):
/// ```dart
/// final result = await withTransaction(pool, (exec) async {
///   final repo = ProdutoRepository(exec);
///   await repo.insert(...);
///   return await repo.findAll();
/// });
/// ```
///
/// The helper handles `begin → body → commit | rollback → close` so
/// callers don't reproduce the 7-line `try/catch/finally` boilerplate
/// for every transaction. If [body] throws, the transaction is rolled
/// back and the original exception is rethrown.

/// Runs [body] inside a new [PostgresUnitOfWork] on a connection

/// ```dart

///   final repo = UserRepository(exec);
///   await repo.insert(User(id: 1, name: 'Ada'));
///   return await repo.findAll();

/// Runs [queries] inside a single Postgres pipeline:
/// `BEGIN; <queries[0]>; ...; <queries[N-1]>; COMMIT;` in **one**
/// network round-trip total (vs N+1 for the sequential [withTransaction]
/// pattern — the BEGIN is fused into the first statement since P5, so it
/// no longer costs a dedicated round-trip; the COMMIT still does).
///
/// **v1 limitation:** result rows are NOT returned (libpq pipeline
/// mode + our watcher's counting strategy discard them). Best suited
/// for bulk writes (`INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE`) where command tags
/// suffice. For mixed read/write patterns where you need rows, use
/// the sequential [withTransaction].
///
/// This self-contained helper is the recommended path for a standalone
/// write batch. When you already hold an external transaction, calling
/// `executePipeline(writes)` inside [withTransaction] also persists
/// correctly (since 2026-07-29) — the pipeline no longer discards the
/// surrounding open transaction.
///
/// On any failure (libpq dispatch error, mid-pipeline error,
/// timeout), the entire pipeline aborts and propagates the exception.
///
/// Added in ABI MAJOR 1 MINOR 1.
