/// Instrumented variant of [withTransaction] for task J diagnostics.

/// Identical lifecycle (`acquire → BEGIN → body → COMMIT|ROLLBACK →
/// release`) but captures Stopwatches around each phase and emits a
/// [TxDiagnostics] event to the provided sink. Bypasses [UnitOfWork]
/// abstraction to keep the timing surface narrow.
///
/// **Intentional divergence from P5 (2026-07-28):** this variant keeps
/// the `BEGIN` **eager** (a standalone dispatch, not fused into the
/// first body statement) so `beginUs` still measures one real
/// round-trip in isolation. It is diagnostic-only (opt-in) and must not
/// be used to benchmark the fused-BEGIN production path.
///
/// Use ONLY when [PoolConfig.instrumentationEnabled] is true. Otherwise
/// `acquireWaitUs`/`queueDepthAtAcquire` arrive null and the
/// diagnostics record is meaningless.
